My personal design system to use across projects.

##### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a NextJS / React application.
- `playground`: A Vite / React application.
- `@mathewbushuru/ui`: a React component library shared by both `docs` and `playground` applications.
- `@mathewbushuru/config`: Shared library configurations e.g Tailwind and Typescript config files.
